			<p>Disclaimer: in this essay I try to evaluate and compare these aircraft by ability and not cost. As this essay is Australia’s best joint strike fighter option. Not the cheapest one.
		</p>
	<p>From its large scale deployment in Iraq to airstrikes in Syria. Australia and more specifically the RAAF (Royal Australian Air Force) has found its self alongside America and England, in what seems like every Middle Eastern conflict since the cold war. [honestly citation needed] Its FA-18 Super Hornets have been Australia's main contribution to these conflicts. Over the years, these aircraft have proven themselves time and time again to be some of the most versatile aircraft ever produced. Nevertheless, 32 years after they entered service in the RAAF. The Australian government is in the process of retiring majority of its surviving Super Hornet fleet.
	</p>
	<p>It was in 1982 that the Australian government purchased its fleet of 75 F/A18A and B (a two seated variant) aircraft. This was to replace its ageing fleet of Dassault Mirage III fighter aircraft. The (at the time highly advanced) F/18 (while not actually as fast as the Mirage III) was far more advanced and had superior range as well as the ability to carry a larger Payload (basically what armaments it could hold (basically MORE THINGS THAT GO BANG)). However, the surviving fleet of 72 Super Hornets currently in service in the RAAF today are (at least internally) very different than the original 75 aircraft purchased in 1982.
</p>
<p>Ironically in the 1990s, due to the introduction of a new generation of fighters (like the MIG-29) by several Asian countries. The air force seriously considered replacing its fleet of FA/18s with Eurofighter Typhoons. However, (according to Wikipedia at least) they concluded that they were "technologically immature". This ended up prompting a massive overhaul and modernization of all 71 of its F/18 aircraft. This included everything from a new radio to a new missile guidance system (the thing that tells the thing that goes BOOM where to go). This upgrade was able to breathe another 20 or so years into the Super Hornets life (in Australian service).
</p>
<p>Unfortunately for the rapidly aging Super Hornets. The Defence White Paper has spoken (I believe its wording was along the lines of "72 Jets, 72 Jets! my budget for 72 Jets!") and our new fleet of F35s is on their way… We hope. We really, really, hope. The Super Hornets problem (at least in Australia and America) is not that it's obsolete. It can still very much hold its own in a dogfight. Its problem is its age. The simple fact is that like technology, the older aircraft get the harder and costlier they are to maintain. This is a massive problem for the US Air Force at the moment. This is due to them having to continually repair and maintain hundreds of aging cold war era aircraft like the A10 thunderbolt's. This is what the Joint Strike Fighter aims to fix, now and into the future. I say into the future because if you have to maintain a fleet of aging aircraft; it's going to be a lot easier if they are all relatively the same aircraft.
</p>
<p>The whole idea around the F-35 is and interesting one. It is actually very different to most conventional attack aircraft. if you asked anyone 10 years ago what makes a good fighter they would say firepower. Let me be clear though the F-35 while designed with air to air combat in mind, is not purely designed as a fighter. When the US was considering it next generation of aircraft. It wanted a Joint Strike Fighter. A fighter that can do anything you throw at it. A ‘one plane solution' to any engagement that may occur. While it is true that currently RAAF uses Super Hornets in all its airstrikes on foreign targets. Super Hornets are not designed as bombers. While they do have the ability to be, as we've seen but they are still primarily air superiority fighters.
</p>
<p>Its main selling point though is its advanced stealth capabilities making it supposedly invisible to most conventional radar. However, this is also its most scrutinised feature. We may never truly know what had to be sacrificed for this amount of stealth. If you ask the Boeing engineering team responsible for their JSF design they'll probably say too much. Whether they are right or not is an argument for another time.
</p>
<p>Something people seem to ignore all too often is the fact that there is more than one type of F-35. Each variant having its own advantages and disadvantages. The F35/A model being purchased by the Australian government (actually the cheapest variant) is the lightest version, and the only version fitted with an internal cannon. It is designed for increased effectiveness against ground targets. Other variants include the F35/B. A vertical take-off and landing variant designed for use on aircraft carriers. Which comes at the sacrifice of fuel capacity for its VTOL system (Vertical Take Off and Landing system). And its bigger, more heavily armoured brother the F35/C.
</p>
<p>When asking the question if the F35 is the right choice for Australia though, you need to consider two things. The first is its effectiveness overseas, as an offensive ground attack aircraft. The second is its effectiveness as a defensive response aircraft. While the debate about its effectiveness as an offensive aircraft is a complicated one, the bottom line is it will do the job. Overseas when it needs to be an effective bomber, being a fighter isn't actually that important. The fact is that the air force of most middle eastern countries is a joke. You would run out of bullets before you would be in any real danger. The only real threat is radar guided ground based AA(anti-air). This is what the F35 is supposedly invisible too.
</p>
<p>The matter of defence is a different story. Australia is a unique case defence wise. This is due to our relatively small army size compared to the large surface area of our continent. This becomes a problem if you only have a limited number of aircraft; available to respond to a situation that may arise in any number of places. An example of this would be if we had a 9/11 style situation where there was a hijacked passenger plane that could be inbound on a heavily populated area from any number of possible angles. In this situation, you may have a handful of fighters at Point Cook air force base. You need to be able to respond and get from point a to point be as fast as possible. This is where it would be better to have faster quick response aircraft like the F-22.
</p>
<p>The reason this is only the case for Australia is that while it may sound like a lot. 72 is not a very large number of aircraft. Not only would a large chunk of them probably be deployed overseas at any one given time, but the rest would have to be spread out around the country. America has a fleet of f-22s but they don't even really need them due to how may f-35s they will be purchasing.

</p>
<p>
While the F-35 definitely isn't the best defensive option, in the end it comes down to priorities. And for most countries I can see why the Joint Strike Fighter is a good option. However, going into the future while we do like to get involved in a lot of middle eastern conflicts. Most of what we actually contribute are logistics support and training. Any actual tactical operations we carry out are done by and a handful of aircraft compared to the large scale operations carried out by the US and UK. Unless we are planning on going to war anytime soon we will continue our relatively small scale operations.
</p>
<p>In the end, it comes down to balance. That balance is for you to decide. This said though, it is more likely, going into the future that these aircraft's most important role will be a defensive one. This is why having faster response aircraft like the F22 is a safer option. However, even I will admit you can only mitigate risk.

			<!--<a href="#menu-toggle" class="btn btn-default" id="menu-toggle">Toggle Menu</a>-->
		<p>As with the rest of the world, in Australia, it seems like once a month now Uber is again forced to dip into the infinite pile of money it keeps under its bed to throw at lobbying in an attempt to get itself legalised in one state or another. But does it actually matter?
		 </p>
	<p>It was only in 2009 that Garrett Camp and Travis Kalanick were given $200,000 in seed funding, to kick-start their brand new start up UberCab. Flash ford to today and both Garrett and Travis are both multibillionaires. Together they have an estimated net worth of over 67 billion. This was enough to land them on forbs’ list of the 200 richest Americans. Their only obstacle seems to be the legal system. This is mostly due to the massive taxi lobbies opposing any changes in taxi or ride-sharing regulations.
	</p>
	<p>Back to the topic at hand though. It has gotten to the point though where no one is really sure if Uber really cares if it’s legalised or not. The millions it throws into lobbying each year seem to be more of a formality than anything. This said though, aggressive lobbying does seem to slowly be working with Uber now officially legal in Western Australia and New South Wales (mostly). The most interesting thing is that the ACT was actually the first place to legalise Uber, despite the war still being waged at a federal level. Despite its legalisation in some states, compared to other states like Victoria there is no real difference in relative growth of passenger numbers. Even with the states themselves, there was no real increase post legalisation. So I guess the real question is if they do really care.
	</p>
	<p>I would argue yes for a few reasons, mostly due to the fact that so far they have seemed to care enough to pour millions into lobbying. I would also argue that legalisation helps more with their driver numbers than anything. Already in Victoria we’ve seen many cases of taxi drivers moonlighting as Uber drivers (before being fired because they treat their customers horribly). They do this mostly because they earn a lot more per hour than they would as a taxi driver. The point I’m getting to is that if ridesharing was legalised it would go a long way towards convincing these people to purely become Uber drivers. This would help reduce surging and also allow Uber to expand more aggressively.
	</P>
	<p>As a whole though it seems that for the moment at least, legalisation is not a massive issue for them, in most countries. Although still definitely one of their biggest issues, the fact is that policing ride sharing companies like Uber is no easy task, due to all transactions occurring online through the app. That’s not to say that their drivers don’t get the occasional fine, but Uber simply forks out the 1,000 or so dollars for it and they go back to driving. It comes down to the drivers making Uber more money than they actually loose to operating illegally. That balance is what all of Ubers lobbying is aimed to maintain In the end. Even if they can’t get themselves legalised they are usually successful in getting the laws changed (for better or worse) to some degree.
</p>
		<p>As Uber continues on its quest for world domination, cutting off larger and larger slices of the taxi industries pie, while not 100% necessary it will be easier if it is actually operating legally. This said though as we have seen it is not necessarily a requirement.</p>

	<div class="box"><h2>Why you shouldn’t use internet explorer</h2>
		<!--<a href="#menu-toggle" class="btn btn-default" id="menu-toggle">Toggle Menu</a>-->
	<p>It was august 1995 the world was floppy disk crazy and the first version of internet explorer was released. Internet explorer came out punching and for the following 3 years battled the reigning champion of the Web browsing world Netscape navigator. However by the year 2000 internet explorer had come out on top and managed to become the world's most used internet browser, holding over 85% market share. But as with the floppy disk all good things must come to an end, something which seems to be reinforced every year in the technology market.  But why are people now saying that internet explorer’s usefulness has come to an end?
</p>
<p>The first and most prominent reason is its speed with other browsers such as Google Chrome and Firefox both loading web pages and Booting (opening) in less than half the time of Internet explorer. This really does mean that in the end internet explorer is just not convenient to use and it’s going to get a lot more annoying for simple things like casual use on a tablet or a laptop when you need to quickly check something. This may seem like a small thing but there’s nothing worse than waiting for something to load when you’re in a rush.
</p>
<p>This is mostly because of its age, and the design philosophy around web browsers at the time (20 years ago). A big part of that philosophy was making it run smoothly on low-end computers which at the time was about half the speed of your smartphone. Even the lowest end tablets today have the processing capability to run web browsers without a noticeable performance decrease. Slightly more power-hungry web browsers that are designed around the understanding of the processing capability of modern computers still follow this lightweight philosophy. These web browsers (like google chrome and Firefox) are better and will continue to get better as Moors law[1] pushes computing forward into the future.
</p>
<p>Another big problem internet explorer has is the fact that Microsoft has been known to take years to properly update it. up until 2003 internet explorer 6 basically had complete market dominance with no change in sight. However, from the ashes of Netscape navigator rose phoenix… before it was banished when it was discovered that the name was already taken… but then rose Firefox which supported new standards like CSS2 [2] and image standards like SVG [3]. Suddenly Apple came out with safari and internet explorer had to fight for its market share. But still there was no real improvement and internet explorer 6 remained. Now, I could write this whole essay on internet explorer 6 but that is a story for another time. For now all you need to know is that it was a web developer’s nightmare. It was so bad that the only way to get your web pages working correctly was to use exploits within Internet Explorer so that web pages would work properly.
</p>
<p>This created its own problems as Microsoft was aware that this was how people were getting their sites to work. This meant that when internet explorer 7 did come out they were unable to fix most of the problems without breaking everyone’s sites. So while the new version fixed some of its issues, quite frankly it still sucked. It was only in 2009 that they actually fixed most of internet explorer’s problems. Although Internet Explorer is actually usable today, it is still lagging behind most other browsers in features. Even simple things like a lot of page animation and JavaScript still don’t work on internet explorer. This might seem like a small thing but as a web designer you spend ¼ of your time writing your website,  ¼ of your time making it work on phones and scale, and ½ your time making it work on internet explorer.</P>
<p>The final issue with internet explorer (not the final issue I could keep going for hours) is a simple one. It comes with windows. This may seem like a good thing but this means that you are far more likely to get hacked or scammed using it than you are on any other browser. This is partly because of its terrible security… actually 90% because of its terrible security. On the other hand it’s partly because of the people who use it. The user base for internet explorer is generally people who don’t have the greatest knowledge of computers and who are therefore a scammer’s greatest target. Whether it’s that simple Adobe flash video on that website you went to (for the love of god don’t use flash player on any websites you’ve never been to before) or that odd email you got, most viruses are designed for internet explorer users.
</p>
<p>Internet explorer’s slow speed, outdated design, and bad security make it a terrible internet browser that should not be used. There is a reason there are news reports of people getting hacked simply by clicking a link, 90% of them would have been using internet explorer or a slow outdated browser like it. There is a reason the newest version of windows, windows 10, comes with another lighter weight internet browser, Microsoft edge. Microsoft has now realized how bad internet explorer is and they are even trying to find alternatives. It is clear that the age of internet explorer is over and it must be replaced with a better, faster web browser.
</p>
<p>Disclaimer: all my statements about market share apart from the map above were based purely off US market share. All of the bold statements I made about Chrome and Firefox searching and starting faster than internet explorer were based off real tests using the latest versions of each respective browser. Due to accepting a large sum of money from myself to write this my views are incredibly biased.</p>
