        <p>Unfortunately we have to learn it anyway so I thought I'd make the process more fun (for me at least). Simply read the data in the paragraph below and write down a reference for it in the APA style. Then <b>click the green button</b> to see how doomed you are. Feedback welcomed at <a href="mailto:jamesblewislewis@gmail.com">jamesblewislewis@gmail.com</a>. Good luck!</p>
        <p>Notes:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>This quiz does <b>NOT</b> cover inline APA as it is too easy!</li>
          <li>At this time this quiz does not support multiple authers as I'm lazy :)</li>
